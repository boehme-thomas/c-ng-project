 * \param src Address of source node
 * \param dest Address of destination node

 * This function is designed to be used as an input callback function and should be used in e.g. nullnet_set_input_callback.
 * It either handles the new schedule or sends it to the next node.
 * When it is not send to the next node, following rules are applied (so data must be send in the correct form to prevent
 * misconfigurations):\n
 *  - if no slotframe is found a new slotframe is added with the respective following parameters\n
 *  - if slotframe is found and timeslot == NULL and channel_offset == NULL, then the existing slotframe is deleted\n
 *  - if slotframe is found and timeslot is found and channel_offset is not NULL, the timeslot is deleted and a new link is created with the parameters\n
 *  - if slotframe is found and timeslot is found and channel_offset == NULL, then the existing timeslot is deleted\n
